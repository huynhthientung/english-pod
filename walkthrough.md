# Walkthrough - Modern English Podcast

I have successfully modernized the English Podcast application. The new app is built with **React**, **Vite**, and **Tailwind CSS**, replacing the legacy jQuery infrastructure with a high-performance modern web stack.

## Key Features

### 1. Modern UI/UX
- **Glassmorphism Design**: Sleek, dark-themed UI with translucent panels and gradients.
- **Responsive Layout**: Works seamlessly on desktop (split view) and mobile (stacked view with sidebar).
- **Interactive Components**: Searchable episode list, custom audio player, and integrated transcript viewer.

### 2. Audio Player with Subtitles
- **Custom Player**: Replaced `jPlayer` with a custom HTML5-based player featuring progress logic and volume controls.
- **Show/Hide Subtitles**: Toggle button to display the full episode transcript inline.

### 3. Theme Support (Light/Dark Mode)
- **Toggle Switch**: Switch between Light, Dark, or System Sync modes.
- **Adaptive UI**: All components (Glassmorphism panels, text, controls) automatically adjust their colors and translucency for optimal readability in both modes.
- **Persistent Preference**: Your theme choice is saved in local storage.

### 4. Data Migration & Offline Capability
- **Structured Data**: Extracted 366 episodes from the legacy `script.js` into `src/data/episodes.json`.
- **Pre-fetched Transcripts**: Downloaded all transcripts from `archive.org` to `public/transcripts/` to ensure they load reliably without CORS errors or broken external links.

### 5. Community & Support
- **Footer**: Added a responsive footer with copyright info and a "Buy Me a Coffee" link.

## Verification Results

### Running Locally
To test the application on your machine:
```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```
This will start a local development server at `http://localhost:5173`.

### Build Status
- `npm run build` completed successfully.
- Assets are minified and optimized in `dist`.

### Deployment to GitHub Pages
I have created a GitHub Actions workflow at `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`.

**To deploy:**
1. Commit and push the changes to GitHub.
2. Go to your repository **Settings > Pages**.
3. Under **Build and deployment**, select **Source** as **GitHub Actions**.
4. The "Deploy to GitHub Pages" workflow will automatically pick up the next push to `main` and deploy the `dist` folder to your site.

## Next Steps
- You can customize the look solely by editing `src/index.css`.
- Add more visualization or features to `src/components/AudioPlayer.jsx` (e.g., playback speed).
